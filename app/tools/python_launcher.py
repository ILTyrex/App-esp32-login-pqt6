"""
python_launcher.py (removed)

This helper was used as a small local launcher during development.
It has been intentionally removed as part of the cleanup of test/demo helpers.
If you later need it, restore from git history or re-create a launcher that
imports `LoginController` or `MainWindow` and runs a `QApplication`.
